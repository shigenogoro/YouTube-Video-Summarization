            "896.0      | 1039.0     | Useful Hotkeys                 | and let's actually select this stuff from the top layer and go ahead and delete it so i'm going to use the rectangular select tool draw a box and i'm going to control x to cut it away now technically when you use cut like that with ctrl x it's still in the buffer so if you ever wanted to paste it in somewhere else you can hit control v and then you can move it around by left-clicking inside of the area and you can just put it wherever you want it to be so if you wanted to move something from one side to the other that's one way you could do it pretty easily but let's actually select that hit control x and forget about it we don't need it anymore so let's talk about a couple other useful hotkeys so i'm going to go back to the paintbrush tool to demonstrate this we already changed our foreground and background color so whatever is your foreground color is the one that you're going to be drawing with with let's say the paintbrush so if i left click and i drag this around the screen you'll see that it uses this red color so the easy way to switch to this other color color color currently the background color is hit x on the keyboard so when i hit x you'll see that the blue and the red swap to places and now i can draw with the blue line i can hit x draw with red line and x draw with blue line so you can see if you want to go back and forth between two colors it's a very fast and easy way to do it the manual way of switching the color color color is to go over here to this little icon that has arrows going in both directions you can click that but honestly if you can learn the hotkeys it's just going to make things a lot faster faster faster another super useful hotkey is control i which which which inverts your selection so let's say we were using the rectangular select tool and we wanted to put a box around this person right so we roughly have have have the person selected but what we actually wanted to do was to cut away the background so rather than drawing separate boxes like one from the top left to here and cutting it away one from the right side to the bottom and cutting that and then the bottom left to the bottom right and cutting that basically creating four boxes what we can just do is invert the selection so if i hit ctrl i on the keyboard keyboard keyboard now we have everything outside of this person's space selected and i can just hit the delete key first we actually have to be on the right layer so um click on the suitcase layer in this case or whatever your image is called and then hit delete so basically whenever you do a change it affects the layer you currently have selected\n",
            "1039.0     | 1122.0     | Make Layer Background Transparent | obviously obviously obviously okay now in this case uh the background turned turned turned red so that's because our active background is set to red and because this was imported as a jpg or jpeg image it does not have an alpha channel so the background can't be transparent if you ever run into that situation where you do want to completely remove the background what you can do is right click on the image go down to add alpha channel add that in there and now with this same selection i hit connect delete again and the background color will be completely removed it has an alpha channel so the background can be transparent and at this point you could bring in let's say another image or add a new layer so i'll just create a new layer here put this down below the suitcase layer so that it's on bottom whatever's on top shows on top whatever's in bottom shows on bottom of course course course uh so let's use the gradient tool here and i'll just make a really quick gradient gradient gradient and just like that i created a background background background that is on a separate layer from the suitcase layer so pretty handy and what's even better is that because we're using separate layers if we decide hey we don't like this gradient well we can just delete the layer for the gradient altogether and have it not affect the original image so once again layers are a great thing okay i'm going to hit ctrl z a few times and we'll go back to before we deleted the character here so next is layer\n",
            "1122.0     | 1287.0     | Layer Masks                    | masks so a mask is basically when you want to hide part of your layer from being visible or used in certain ways um so the basic way of using the mask is you want to hide part of the background without actually removing it it's just that the mask doesn't allow it to show through so to add a layer mask to a layer we right click the layer and choose add layer mask and we're going to initialize this with full opacity so you can see the color white means it's visible full opacity opacity opacity and the color black means it's fully transparent so you don't actually draw colors on a layer mask but you draw different shades of white or black so i'm going to initialize it with full opacity and because everything in the layer mask is white that means everything in the layer mask is going to be visible so now if i change to the brush tool so you could draw with the color on the layer mask and in that case in a sense it's going to be looking at the brightness of that color so a color that's closer to black will hide more if you draw on the layer mask with it and a color that's closer to white is going to allow more of the original image to show through but because it just over complicates things i would definitely use a shade of white or black just so you know exactly what you're getting and you don't have that uh color kind of getting in the way of things so if you want something to be more transparent then make it closer to black over you and if you want something on your layer mask to be more visible then bring it up here to white in the top left-hand corner so i will draw with black for right now so we're just gonna use 100 black html notation zero zero zero zero zero zero so now if we take this paint brush and and and we can also set the harness that is relevant since the edging will always have that blur we can draw on our image to hide stuff so i'll just take this brush and stroke it across the image image image and we can kind of go crazy with this as long as we want to be hiding stuff so you see as we add black to the layer mask more of the image hides and it's not actually removing it from the image if i right click and i let's say disable the layer mask then you can see the image is still there so this is another way to add it non-destructively which is handy handy handy right so if i wanted to show it again i can switch to a white color so changing this to the background color hitting hitting hitting x to make the background color active color so we can switch between black and white using x once again like earlier and now i'm gonna use the paintbrush to show more of the mask again so if i just stroke back over this then we can take the mask and make it visible again so pretty handy there\n",
            "1287.0     | 1517.0     | Paths Tool                     | so next would be a decent chance to talk about the paths or the pen tool depending on which program you're used to so paths tool is over here it's b i think they use the key b because it's referring to bezier curves as in you can add handles to each of the points to curve the shape rather than having straight lines i'll show you what i mean there in a minute and what we can do with the paths tool is to draw a shape and have more control over it so it won't just be a simple rectangle or a simple circle or ellipse ellipse ellipse but it's actually more of a custom shape that we set many points on and what we can use this for is actually cut the girl out of the original photo and one reason we might do that is we want to combine her inside of another photo maybe not the most realistic thing initially but it's a pretty simple photo operation so let's go ahead and use the paths tool so path tool uh stay in design mode over here here here i'm gonna zoom in control middle mouse wheel and you can left click to add a point so this will be one of the points for our shape and you can left click to add another point so by default it's a straight line and you can keep left clicking to basically draw a shape around and it's one way that you can separate separate separate a character from everything else in the graphic graphic graphic you can see that these are all straight lines but there may be cases where you'd want to actually add a curve shape to it so this is where the bezier curve thing comes into place so when you left click to add a point actually hold it down and if you drag it away there will be these handles that pop out and depending on the position of these handles they will control the shape of the curve so so so rather than having a straight line between two points you can get something more of a curve that might make more sense with the head because heads aren't squares they're much more circular or oval shape and um once you add the point you can actually adjust these handles individually so you'll see the left handle affects the shape of the curve on the left side and the right handle adjusts the shape of the curve on the right side you can also left click on existing points if you hold ctrl down and you left click on it you'll you'll basically add the curve handles to it so this one coming out on this side and then i'll click on it again and we'll add the extra handle coming out of the right hand side now when we want to continue editing our shape i'm going to left click on the end point here and then we'll left click and you might notice the little plus sign there indicating we're adding a new point and i'll continue adding the next point and you'll see that even if we um i'll hit ctrl z to undo that if i just left click here you'll see that there's a curve even though i'm not setting any curves on the right endpoint because there's still the curves from this left point that is actually controlling the shape of the right hand side so the curves on one point can affect both sides of the path tool and we can continue making it straight by not having any curves and we can continue just with simple straight operations by left-clicking after this making sure that none of these points have any additional handles if we just want to keep it as simple and straight and you know in general i just find it a little bit quicker to work with the straight lines but whatever you want to do depends on how precise you want to be and we'll just keep outlining the shape of the person as we go down here so let's keep going until we basically have it done okay so we've almost outlined the entire shape here to finish the last point we actually need to hold control down and then left click on the starting point so you'll see this little linking icon here once you connect them then you have a full path\n",
