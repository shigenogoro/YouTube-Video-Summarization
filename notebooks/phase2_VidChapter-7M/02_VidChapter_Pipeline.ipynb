Putting the positioning finger down around 8 o'clock to get it back inside on the hook race, I guess is what I would call it.  I'm trying to do it through the camera here. See if I can get a better look at it for you. Should be right about there.  Oh no, it's so clean it won't go back together. The problem is it's easy to get in at an angle or a slant and then it doesn't want to travel smoothly in there. See that? See that movement?  So I don't think I have it in there properly. Seems to me, put the, put what I guess I'd call the bottom edge at this position, down in first, and then tilt the top in. Still doesn't want to go in there.  Now when I did the video on the 301 hook, that's exactly what I did. This one I'm having a little bit of a hassle with. It just doesn't seem to want to fall back flat in there. There. So before I turn it, let's see where that is.  yeah it's still seven or eight o'clock mm-hmm I think I was up a little too close to nine but now that it's in there see if it will rotate good let's put the let's put the jib jib back up here  I won't put the screw back in it, but let's just turn it here and see. Because it's going to be stationary with that positioning finger up and the hook's going to rotate like that. So it feels good and smooth. Okay. Let's see about getting that little dinky hook back in, uh, screw back in the jib hook now.  hmm boy is that tiny hmm probably should have got my reading glasses for this huh I might set that down I'm trying to turn it backwards to get it seated a little bit  There we go. Be sure that you're not cross-threaded or anything like that. You don't want to have to deal with trying to replace the screw or repair the threads in the hook.  We do need this tightened completely though. I'll just try this again. Nice and firmly in there. Okay, so if we're putting this loop guard now on the back, we want to remember that the part number faces out at us  I'll slide it on there. And we'll line that up. At least I get to work with a little tiny bit bigger screw. That might go on my spring driver.  nope guess not oh okay let's try that got it in there at least didn't get started very far so I'll finish it up  I just realized after I came back from washing these parts, I didn't turn my other lights on. Let's go ahead and do that. Okay, now that I'm all done. Okay, good and clean.  Before I go to put this back on, there's a couple things I want to do. Let's turn it so that the hook point is up at the top.\", 'title': 'ASSEMBLE HOOK'}\n",
            "Example 2: {'video_id': '2-NfbOCPd2Q', 'start': 335.0, 'end': 517.0, 'text': \"Wouldn't it be amazing? Let's leave group sets to one side and focus on bikes. I'm not going to focus on actual bike models because they're too many to name. You can let me know what bikes you expect to see updated down below. I'm talking about trends. The first trend, which is an obvious one,  E-bikes are going to continue to grow and grow in 2021. We're going to see a lot more bike brands jumping on the e-bike bandwagon. Hopefully, you can see the prices come down, the weights come down, the range go up, and just generally better packages. That latest Shimano motor looks really good, really impressive ride quality. More investment from more manufacturers in really smart, lightweight, smooth-running e-bike technology.  and you might think e-bikes aren't for you, which is fine, but they're clearly for a lot of people. Now, my local bike shops here during the lockdown, which definitely helped their fortunes, they sold a ton of e-bikes. They couldn't keep up with demand. The demand for e-bikes was massive.  When I get riding my local trails or further afield, there are e-bikes everywhere. Recently, I went to Bike Park Wales, a very popular uplift bike park here in South Wales. Well, not here, I don't live in South Wales, but nearby, not far away from me. There are loads of e-bikes. There are more e-bikes than normal bikes.  and it makes perfect sense. You have your own uplift, you get to the top of the hill really easily, you bomb down, you don't have to use the uplift service, so it's cheaper in the long run, and you have more freedom to explore trails in a way you can't probably do on a normal bike. So e-bikes are really popular. And also, when you look at the prices of e-bikes, some normal bikes are crazy, crazy pricey, $10,000, euros, pounds, easily, but you get an e-bike for the same price.  And if you've been riding bikes for a long time and you have a lot of bikes in your garage already, you might be looking at your bike thinking, well, I've got all the bikes that cover all the riding I do. Why buy the latest version of what I already have? Why not buy something totally different and buy an e-bike? And it can coexist alongside your normal bikes. They offer a different ride experience. And for me, having ridden a few e-bikes, the ride experience is all about fun. E-bikes really put the fun back into riding. They really put fun front and center of what really matters.  You can ride further, ride faster. You do more descending. You can go up the hills easier and go up the hills faster, and you still get a good workout on an e-bike. I've used a heart rate monitor on an e-bike, and you really get a good workout. Your heart rate goes up, so it's not cheating in any way. You just find yourself going further, faster, and riding for longer because you have that e-bike. What it does is remove the fitness barrier that does exist for a lot of people in mountain biking, especially if you live somewhere hillier,  and you might run out of puff after a couple of laps. With an e-bike, you do a couple more laps. You do double what you might do on a normal bike. E-bikes are starting to become more popular. I like to see them go lighter, longer range, and just more integration of the technology into the bikes to make  them handle the way a normal bike does with lesser compromises that the weight and other issues impacts a normal bike. So yeah, expect to see a lot more e-bikes.\", 'title': 'E-Bikes to get even more popular'}\n"

For this video, I'm going to give a quick overview of Ally Bank for those of you new to the bank. Then we'll go over interest rates, my experience with using customer service, and then my favorite features of Ally Bank.  After watching this video, you should be able to decide if it's worth it to switch to Ally Bank. With their rates just dropping down to 0.60%, stay to the end of the video to see if I'm going to stay with Ally Bank. This video isn't sponsored by Ally Bank. I'm just trying to help other people decide on the best high yield savings accounts by sharing my experience. Hey guys, what's going on? If you're new here, my name is Davis and welcome to my channel. Each week I make new videos on personal finance and wealth building, so subscribe and click the notification bell so you don't miss out on my next video.\n",
            "42.0       | 85.0       | Ally Bank Overview             | Ally is a popular online-only bank account that likely got popular due to its high interest rates and its no-fee service. Ally offers online checking accounts, savings accounts, investing accounts, and much more. I currently use Ally Bank for my main checking and savings accounts. What initially got me to join Ally Bank was the high yield savings account at 2% and then also all the good online reviews I saw and then good reviews from my own friends.  Ally Bank has no minimum requirement to open up a new account. Also, no monthly maintenance fees. Originally opened up my checking account, I only had $1 in there for months and actually incurred no fees or no penalties. Though Ally Bank is online only, you can use any ATM and then withdraw money from there and you won't incur any kind of fees.\n",
            "85.0       | 155.0      | Ally Bank Interest Rates vs the competition | When I joined Ally Bank in early 2019, interest rates for Ally were about 2.1%. But due to what's happening and the Federal Reserve dropping rates to 0%, online bank accounts have started to follow. Since September 2020, Ally interest rates have dropped to just 0.60%, meaning for every $10,000 you invest, you get just $60 in interest.  Although this sounds incredibly low, compared to bigger banks, this is significantly higher. For example, Wells Fargo, Chase, and Bank of America offer just 0.01%, plus they have monthly maintenance fees and other kind of penalties. Now, let's compare Ally Bank to some of its online competitors. There's markets by Goldman Sachs, American Express, Discover, and PNC. They currently have interest rates of 0.80%, but will likely fall to 0.60%.  As I was doing research into these other online banks, Ally's rate was still 0.80%, but as of this morning, the rate dropped down to 0.60% and the other banks are likely to follow. I know this seems horribly low for a high yield savings account. However, watch the next few parts to see other great features that Ally Bank has to offer. Let me know down in the comments below who you currently bank with and who you're trying to switch from.\n",
            "155.0      | 192.0      | My experience with Ally Bank Customer Service | After banking with Ally Bank for a little bit more than one year, Ally's customer service has been pretty good. They currently have live chat for their customer support. A year of banking with Ally Bank, there's only been two times where I had to reach out to them to get some help, and it was a good experience. The first time they answered my questions pretty quickly about recurring transfers. The second time I had to work with them was when I had to do my wire transfer of my property purchase. Things went through without a hitch, and then I also was able to get a status update by just doing a live chat.  For me, I really like the fact that they do have a live chat because it's better than calling into a big bank and then just waiting and waiting and just keep on waiting.\n",
            "192.0      | 233.0      | A game changer: Ally Bank Savings Buckets | For me, I really like the fact that they do have a live chat because it's better than calling into a big bank and then just waiting and waiting and just keep on waiting. One of my favorite features of Ally Bank is their savings buckets. I previously banked with Wells Fargo and I currently have an account with Chase and neither of them have this feature. For Wells Fargo, it was really dumb because I had to open up multiple savings accounts in order to separate out my savings.  For me, I want to be able to visually see the difference between my savings from my vacations, real estate, and other kinds of savings. With Ally Banking, I have just one savings account with multiple buckets. You can even name the different buckets for your various savings goals. You can also set up monthly recurring transfers from your checking account to the various different savings buckets. Now each month, instead of seeing one amount for my savings, I can see my savings goals split up into different buckets.\n",
            "233.0      | 279.0      | Another great feature: Recurring Zelle Transfers | Now each month, instead of seeing one amount for my savings, I can see my savings goals split up into different buckets.  This is probably a feature that's commonly available across multiple banks. However, I wanted to highlight that Ally Bank can also do automatic recurring transfers between Ally accounts and then from other bank accounts. One major feature that Wells Fargo doesn't have that Ally does have is you can set up automatic recurring Zelle transfers from your account to another person. For example, if you split the monthly internet bill with your roommates and then each month you either have to manually Venmo them or log in and do a manual transfer, with Ally you can set up a monthly recurring Zelle transfer from your account to your roommate.  I know this feature might seem like something very minor, however, that's just one less thing you have to think of each month. In the next section, I'm going to go over whether or not I'm going to stay or leave Ally Bank, and then also who I think should completely avoid Ally.\n",
            "279.0      | 399.0      | Am I staying with Ally Bank & Who Shouldn't use Ally Bank | Although Ally's interest rates have dropped significantly since I joined and their current rate is only 0.60%, it's such a small amount, I still think the Ally bank is worth it in 2020. Almost all online high yield savings accounts are starting to follow the trend towards 0% interest rate anyways, so when you're looking at different banks, start to look more at the features than the actual interest rate.  I recommend joining Ally Bank if you're looking for a good online bank with good customer service, a modern interface, an easy way to set up savings buckets, an easy way to set up recurring transfers between you and your friends or roommates, and then you never have to worry about any kind of fees. I'm about to go over who shouldn't join Ally Bank, but if you made it this far and you want to help me out, click the like button as it'll tell YouTube to share this video to more people.  Advise against joining Ally Bank if you're someone who deals with a lot of cash because there isn't a way to directly deposit cash straight into your Ally Bank account. All you'd have to do is deposit your cash into your other bank account and then transfer it over to your Ally Bank account.  I don't know if it's worth your time and energy. However, if you struggle with any kind of penalties or fees, then Ally Bank might be the choice for you. For me, I personally don't use too much cash and I make almost all my purchases using my credit card, which is automatically paid off by my Ally checking account. So Ally Bank has worked perfectly for me. Despite Ally's rates dropping to 0.60%, I'll be sticking around with Ally because I have automated all of my checking, savings, credit card statements, and I don't ever have to worry about any kind of fees.  Speaking of credit cards, if you're looking to get into credit card rewards and looking for a no fee credit card, I previously made a video which I'll link up above and then down below. Or you can check out my videos on what to do before you invest, which I'll link over here. Thanks for watching. I'll see you guys next week.\n",
